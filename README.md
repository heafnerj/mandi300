# mandi300
Development of mandi v3.0.0
To experiment, get mandi300.sty, mandiexp300.sty, and mandi300test.tex. 
The files mandi300testlua.tex and mandi300testlua.pdf are redundant and are not needed.
The files nicematrix.sty and tensor.sty are placeholders until the devs upload corrected versions to CTAN.
